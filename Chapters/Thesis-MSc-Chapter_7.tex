This work focused on evaluating the security features of the Microsemi SmartFusion2 board, modelling its performance, and developing a proof of concept system to secure communication channels between devices.

\section{Overview} \label{chap:conclusion:overview}

The SmartFusion2 SoC provides a varied array of security services using symmetric keys: AES with 128 and 256 bit key encryption, SHA-256, HMAC authentication with 256 bit SHA and a SHA based key derivation function. For asymmetric cryptography it offers ECDH for key generation, and additional ECC primitives, with the P-384 NIST defined curve, which can be used to implement digital signatures. Lastly, a true random number generator, a PUF based secure storage solution, tamper detection capabilities with several detection flags, and a zeroization feature with multiple recoverability options.

The prototype implemented on the device, focused on the implementation of a service which provides authentication and encryption to a TCP channel, using symmetric keys. The system is able to encrypt up to 36 KB of data using the AES and HMAC accelerators, with adequate 256 bit security. This limitation is imposed, due to the limited 80 KB of RAM.
This hurdle was overcome by implementing a continuous authenticated encryption service, using an HMAC software implementation, and taking advantage of the characteristic of the AES CBC mode.

A key generation service using asymmetric key pairs was also implemented. It generates a shared secret, using an internal private key and a public key.
The system also has a limitation in its ECC primitives. It does not provide an ECDSA implementation. In order to implement signatures, a big numbers library must be included in the device. The inclusion of such a library is complex due to its tendency to be heavy in code space and the device's limited RAM memory, even when disabling error correction and detection (80 KB). 

Regarding key management, the PUF secure storage service is limited to 1000 write cycles for a predicted twenty year lifespan. To mitigate this, a key management service was developed, which stores the keys encrypted in a non volatile memory using the PUF service. This allows the update of multiple keys with only one PUF write for each update, instead of one write per key.

This work also contributes with an extensive characterization of the SmartFusion2 device. It studied each security service advantage and possible trade offs. Furthermore, it models the performance of every service, providing a useful prediction of the system's behaviour. Lastly, the implemented prototype provides solid groundwork for a secure communications service, in a low cost HSM device.

\section{Future Work} \label{chap:conclusion:future-work}

This work can be improved by implementing fully working digital signatures. To achieve this, a lightweight big integer library, with all arithmetic operations in the ECDSA algorithm is needed. It should support 48 byte integers, and have a maximum memory footprint of around 50 KB, to fit in the 80 KB of RAM with error detection and correction disabled, while keeping the secure communication and key management services enabled.
% For signature generation of unlimited data sizes, a continuous SHA implementation is necessary, since the board does not offer one.
% Future work could also test, using the secure communications service, an encrypted connection between two similar devices, running the existing prototype. The connection could be TLS encrypted, using the board to encrypt and authenticate the data, with internal symmetric keys. %This connection could be improved with a TLS implementation, using internal symmetric keys.
% Finally, the AES, SHA and HMAC cores are not side-channel protected. This includes AES, SHA-256 and HMAC. This could be improved by implementing cryptographic core's of its services using the FPGA.
