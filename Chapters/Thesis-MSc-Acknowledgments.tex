% Thank my parents, ... Grandma
I would like to thank my parents for always supporting me, encouraging me, and providing everything I need to succeed, throughout all my life. Without them this work and degree would not be possible. I also want to thank my grandma for always being a friend and supporter, even through hard times.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to my dissertation supervisor Prof. Ricardo Chaves for his support, knowledge and constant willingness to help, and push me to do better. His insights and our discussions have made me a better engineer. This experience is a valuable tool I will carry into my future as a professional.

Last but not least, to all my significant other, long time friends and colleagues that always helped me, and were there for me when I needed through tougher periods of my life. I will always be there for you. Thank you.
